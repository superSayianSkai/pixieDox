### 1. **HTML Canvas**
   - Learn how to use the `<canvas>` element.
   - Understand the 2D rendering context (`getContext('2d')`) for drawing shapes, lines, and images.

### 2. **JavaScript Basics**
   - Handling DOM events, such as mouse and touch events.
   - Manipulating the canvas using methods like `moveTo()`, `lineTo()`, `stroke()`, etc.

### 3. **Mouse and Touch Events**
   - Capture user interactions like:
     - `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` for drawing with a mouse.
     - `touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend` for touch screens.

### 4. **State Management**
   - Keep track of:
     - Whether the user is currently drawing.
     - The position of the mouse or touch point.
   - Store the color, brush size, and other settings.

### 5. **Drawing Shapes**
   - Understand how to draw basic shapes like lines, rectangles, circles, etc.
   - Implement freehand drawing by connecting consecutive points.

### 6. **Customizing Tools**
   - Add options for brush size, color, and shape.
   - Include tools like an eraser, fill, or shape drawer.

### 7. **Canvas Manipulation**
   - Learn about:
     - Clearing the canvas (`clearRect()`).
     - Saving and restoring the drawing state.

### 8. **Saving the Artwork**
   - Use `canvas.toDataURL()` to save the drawing as an image.

### 9. **Undo/Redo Functionality**
   - Implement undo/redo by saving snapshots of the canvas at various states.

### 10. **Advanced Features (Optional)**
   - Add layers to allow users to work on different parts of the drawing separately.
   - Integrate image uploading and editing.
